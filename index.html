        <h1>Tamara Tayebs Biography</h1>
        <p>
         i am in 10th grade , and i live in the middle east. 
         The reason why i joined is pretty... interesting.
         My dad is a computer engineer, and i was never close to my dad ,
         that is until i started learning about his interests.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, here i am trying to learn as much as i can so i can go 
         rant to my dad all about it ( i also have absolutely no idea what i want to be for the future so I'm exploring my
         interests ). 
         My interests in technology, to be honest are , how people use technology <strong>to help better the world.</strong>
         Something as simple as creating a website where a certain group of people can connect, or, something as big as 
         a hearing aid.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Information </h2>
        <p>
         My hobbies are rather basic i would say, I love every form of music, singing ,guitar, piano, violin,etc. 
        </p>
        <p>
         I have one sister and two brothers, all of which are older than me. oddly enough between each sibling is three years, 
         except between my oldest brother and sister. 
         The second youngest brother is my best friend, literally. I don't make 
         friends easily, nor do i know how to be a good friend.
        </p>
        <p>
         But, my brother has always loved me regardless of what I wore,
         or what i looked like, or how i get scared at random moments.
        </p>
        <p>
         I love listening to others opinions and points of view,and
         especially when someone asks a deep question,a meaningful one.
