             <h2>our friday class.. games!</h2>
             <p>tamara tayeb / aug 3rd, 2021</p> 

            <p>
             On Friday’s class we were assigned to design a game with the following
             conditions: easy-to-play app game that can teach teens how income 
             inequality can impact their ability to learn in school.
            </p>
            <p>
             So the “story” was that we were contacted by a non-profit organization
             that is in pursuit to create a game that teaches about income inequality 
             to teens and how it can impact their ability to learn. Our game “inspo” 
             was animal crossing!
            </p> 
            <p>  
             So imagine the game with me ( the following idea was created by the 
             whole team!) :
            <p>      
             Welcome to the game of; <strong>doors of destiny</strong>
            </p>
            <p>          
             Created by the company called;  MDSLT  
            </p> 
            <p>
             Once the player clicks on the game they would see their character in the
             middle, and in front of the character are many doors that will determine
             their <strong>destiny!</strong> Each door is of a different part of a specific 
             country or as the level gets higher, a specific part of the world.
             On the right bottom of the screen it would say how much money a person
             has made… game money of course, on the bottom left is the game’s store!
            </p>
            <p>
             when the player enters the first door a notification will pop up, the
             notification will have the following information:
             where the character is,what character they are, what family the
             character has, and what tasks the player has to get done.
             After the player clicks okay they start the game! As the player 
             starts the game they would have to go to school and do what i like
             to call 'typical teenage tasks'. On the top right of
             the screen would be a metaphoric 24hrs, once those “24hrs” 
             are complete whatever money the player got they can unlock new
             characters with that money faster. The game will look like animal
             crossing but more realistic, like the games sims or GTA.
            </p>
            <p>
             If a person wants to unlock new doors faster they would buy new worlds
             ( which also supports our non-profit company).
          
             And that is it! The more tasks they get done as a certain teenage 
             character the more points they get. 
            </p>
            <p>
             (the following is a personal opinion/point of view) 
             The lesson we want players to learn through this game is that as a teen,
             especially in high school, it will not always be easy, and at times 
             when it comes to income as a teen, it is many times unfair. The game 
             changes the character to show the player that every person has differences 
             and sometimes the system is not equal,unfortunately.the character attends 
             school to show how different schools function and how the community around 
             the school affects the school, and possibly the education as well.
             A character’s background, like their family, or up-ringing could play a 
             role in what school they attend, how much money they have, and as unfortunate
             as it sounds how well they are treated.
          
           
             Hope this was as interesting to you as it was to me!

             the video below is a simple breakdown about web develpment 
             all explained in just 10 MINUTES! i chose this video because
             it was super simple yet so intruiging and above all the
             editing done in the video is very interesting. enjoy!

           <h2>is cryptography impactful?</h2>
           <p>tamara tayeb / july 23rd, 2021</p>
           <p>
             Without cryptography the world would not be as modern as it is, 
             Cryptography is all around us, quite literally, this blog is being 
             read through an encrypted website! 
           </p>
           <p>
             Isn’t it interesting to realize that we have been using cryptography 
             all our lives, most of the time we ordinary people use cryptology in
             a more straightforward manner, versus the very complex manner, which 
             is found more often in websites and used in big corporations, etc. 
           </p>
           <p>
             It all started in us, from having a secret word between two best 
             friends, then having to create your email password, the bank password,
             etc., most of those required cryptography, as many people replace their 
             words with numbers or change up a word that has significance to them to
             make it encrypted. 
           </p>
           <p>
             Cryptography is for the most part safe and positive. A couple facts may be:
             Data encryption keeps information distinct from the security of the device 
             on which it is stored. Also, the data is secure regardless of how it is sent, 
             since the encryption is on the data itself, plus, several organizations are 
             required to comply with strict confidentiality requirements as well as other 
             related regulations, data that has been encrypted can only be read by the
             recipient who possesses the key to decrypt it.
           </p>
           <p>
             For example, a food company, the company would have recipes that are required
             to be secret, yet that recipe must be shared with the employees of the company.
             Here, the company could have the recipe encrypted therefore only the employees
             of that company will know what the recipe is, even if the note or paper or message 
             of the recipe got to someone who was not working there, they would not know the
             recipe... smart I would say. In addition to that, it is a big company after all, 
             it could have many important documents of how the company is run, important files 
             of the employees, company transactions, etc. Most documents nowadays are in computers, 
             if those documents are encrypted, no matter who may get access to the computer or 
             documents they would not know the company secrets, as all their information has been 
             encrypted.
           </p>
           <p>
             Cryptography is a vital aspect that many of us never really noticed, including me. 
             Cryptography has and will continue to evolve, we are all born with the skill of encryption,
             it just depends who is willing to grow that talent and who is willing to let it die.
