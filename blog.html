        <h2>is cryptography impactful?</h2>
        <p>tamara tayeb / july 23rd, 2021</p>
        <p>
         Without cryptography the world would not be as modern as it is, 
         Cryptography is all around us, quite literally, this blog is being 
         read through an encrypted website! 
        </p>
        <p>
         Isn’t it interesting to realize that we have been using cryptography 
         all our lives, most of the time we ordinary people use cryptology in
         a more straightforward manner, versus the very complex manner, which 
         is found more often in websites and used in big corporations, etc. 
        </p>
        <p>
         It all started in us, from having a secret word between two best 
         friends, then having to create your email password, the bank password,
         etc., most of those required cryptography, as many people replace their 
         words with numbers or change up a word that has significance to them to
         make it encrypted. 
        </p>
        <p>
         Cryptography is for the most part safe and positive. A couple facts may be:
         Data encryption keeps information distinct from the security of the device 
         on which it is stored. Also, the data is secure regardless of how it is sent, 
         since the encryption is on the data itself, plus, several organizations are 
         required to comply with strict confidentiality requirements as well as other 
         related regulations, data that has been encrypted can only be read by the
         recipient who possesses the key to decrypt it.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, a food company, the company would have recipes that are required
         to be secret, yet that recipe must be shared with the employees of the company.
         Here, the company could have the recipe encrypted therefore only the employees
         of that company will know what the recipe is, even if the note or paper or message 
         of the recipe got to someone who was not working there, they would not know the
         recipe... smart I would say. In addition to that, it is a big company after all, 
         it could have many important documents of how the company is run, important files 
         of the employees, company transactions, etc. Most documents nowadays are in computers, 
         if those documents are encrypted, no matter who may get access to the computer or 
         documents they would not know the company secrets, as all their information has been 
         encrypted.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cryptography is a vital aspect that many of us never really noticed, including me. 
         Cryptography has and will continue to evolve, we are all born with the skill of encryption,
         it just depends who is willing to grow that talent and who is willing to let it die.
